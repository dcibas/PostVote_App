# PostVote_App
Full-Stack Voting Forum Application

The main idea was to create a web voting forum application. In the application, users can post a vote that is valid for a certain period of time. Users who have posted their voting ad can edit it. When the voting announcement expires or the administrator deletes it, the user can announce a new vote again. Users can also vote, express their opinion on any of the active voting posts. They can do this only once, choosing one of the four possible options - strongly disagree, partly disagree, partly agree and strongly disagree.
